# Statusfy

> A marvelous Open Source Status Page system

Statusfy is a Status Page System, easy to use and completely Open Source. You can easily create a fast System, [**Static Generated**](https://marquez.co/docs/statusfy/guide/architecture.html#static-generated), and easily deploy it to a variety of [hosting services](https://marquez.co/docs/statusfy/guide/deploy.html).

A Statusfy site is a Web Application, created on top of [Eleventy][eleventy], [Netlify CMS][netlifycms] and [Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss]. It is used **Eleventy** to make a quick and useful abstraction of the system generation, **Vue** and **Nuxt.js** to dynamically define the System Editor, and **Tailwind CSS** to rapidly define the default themes.


## Features

## Getting started

It‚Äôs pretty easy to get started with Statusfy. Install it globally with npm:

***Make sure you have [npx][npx] installed (npx is shipped by default since [npm][npm] 5.2.0)***

``` bash
# change the working directory
cd existing_folder

# run the initialization command
npx @statusfy/cli init

# and install your local dependencies

```

Create a new incident with this command:

``` bash
npm run new-incident # OR yarn new-incident
```

and launch the development server with:

``` bash

```

You can later also generate the final Website with:

``` bash
npm run generate # OR yarn generate
```
